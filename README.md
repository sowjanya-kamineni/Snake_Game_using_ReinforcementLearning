# Snake_Game_using_ReinforcementLearning
•	Developed an AI model using deep learning techniques like Q-learning in Python to train the agent. Here, we enable the snake to learn reflexes based on the techniques it acquired during training.
•	Here I used a Reinforcement technique to make the agent(Snake) play the game without human interaction.
